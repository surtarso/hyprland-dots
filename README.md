### These are **my** configurations to be used with Hyprland, installed using [ArchRiot](https://github.com/CyphrRiot/ArchRiot) ISO.
#### *This repository serves the only purpose of backing up my configurations to restore them in case something breaks.*
Feel free to snoop around and/or ask questions, but keep in mind these are **my personal configs** for **my personal use**.
